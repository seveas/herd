# Sharness

Sharness is a portable shell library to write, run, and analyze automated tests
for Unix programs. Since all tests output TAP, the [Test Anything Protocol],
they can be run with any TAP harness.

Each test is written as a shell script, for example:

```sh
#!/bin/sh

test_description="Show basic features of Sharness"

. ./sharness.sh

test_expect_success "Success is reported like this" "
    echo hello world | grep hello
"

test_expect_success "Commands are chained this way" "
    test x = 'x' &&
    test 2 -gt 1 &&
    echo success
"

return_42() {
    echo "Will return soon"
    return 42
}

test_expect_success "You can test for a specific exit code" "
    test_expect_code 42 return_42
"

test_expect_failure "We expect this to fail" "
    test 1 = 2
"

test_done
```

Running the above test script returns the following (TAP) output:

    $ ./simple.t
    ok 1 - Success is reported like this
    ok 2 - Commands are chained this way
    ok 3 - You can test for a specific exit code
    not ok 4 - We expect this to fail # TODO known breakage
    # still have 1 known breakage(s)
    # passed all remaining 3 test(s)
    1..4

Alternatively, you can run the test through [prove(1)]:

    $ prove simple.t
    simple.t .. ok
    All tests successful.
    Files=1, Tests=4,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.02 usr +  0.00 sys =  0.02 CPU)
    Result: PASS

Sharness was derived from the [Git] project - see [README.git] for the original
documentation.

## Installation

First, clone the Git repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/chriscool/sharness.git

Then choose an installation method that works best for you:

### Per-project installation

If you like to add Sharness to the sources of a project you want to
use it for, simply copy the files `sharness.sh`,
`aggregate-results.sh`, and `test/Makefile` to a folder named `test`
inside that project, and then set SHARNESS_TEST_SRCDIR to this folder
somewhere, export it, and source $SHARNESS_TEST_SRCDIR/sharness.sh in
your test files.

See for example how setting SHARNESS_TEST_SRCDIR is done in
[test/simple.t](test/simple.t#L5-L7)
and in the `install` target of the [Makefile](Makefile#L26).

The requirement to set SHARNESS_TEST_SRCDIR is new in current
master. It used to be possible to only copy files and source
`sharness.sh`, but https://github.com/chriscool/sharness/pull/90
changed that. 

Another way is to use [Sharnessify](https://github.com/chriscool/sharnessify).

Alternatively, you can also add Sharness as a Git submodule to your project.

In per-project installation, Sharness will optionally load extensions from
`sharness.d/*.sh` if a `sharness.d` directory is found in the same directory
as `sharness.sh`. This allows per-project extensions and enhancements to
be added to the test library without requiring modification of `sharness.sh`.

### Per-user installation

    $ cd sharness
    $ make install

This will install Sharness to `$HOME/share/sharness`, and its documentation and
examples to `$HOME/share/doc/sharness`.

### System-wide installation

    $ cd sharness
    # make install prefix=/usr/local

This will install Sharness to `/usr/local/share/sharness`, and its documentation
and examples to `/usr/local/share/doc/sharness`.

Of course, you can change the _prefix_ parameter to install Sharness to any
other location.

### Installation via Chef

If you want to install Sharness with Opscode Chef, the [Sharness cookbook] is
for you.

## Usage

The following files are essential to using Sharness:

* `sharness.sh` - core shell library providing test functionality, see separate
   [API documentation]. Meant to be sourced from test scripts, but not executed.
* `aggregate-results.sh` - helper script to aggregate test results
* `test/Makefile` - test driver. The default target runs the complete testsuite.

To learn how to write and run actual test scripts based on `sharness.sh`, please
read [README.git] until I come up with more documentation myself.

### Command-line options

The `*.t` test scripts have the following options (again, read
[README.git] for details) :

* `--debug`, `-d`: helps debugging
* `--immediate`, `-i`: stop execution after the first failing test
* `--long-tests`, `-l`: run tests marked with prereq EXPENSIVE
* `--interactive-tests`: run tests marked with prereq INTERACTIVE
* `--help`, `-h`: show test description
* `--verbose`, `-v`: show additional debug output
* `--quiet`, `-q`: show less output
* `--chain-lint`/`--no-chain-lint`: check &&-chains in scripts
* `--no-color`: don't color the output
* `--tee`: also write output to a file
* `--verbose-log`: write output to a file, but not on stdout
* `--root=<dir>`: create trash directories in `<dir>` instead of current directory.

Furthermore, as Sharness was derived from Git, [Git's test suite](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/t)
is worth examining as well, especially if you're interested in managing a big
number of tests.
